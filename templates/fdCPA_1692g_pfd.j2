Re: Validation Request under 15 U.S.C. §1692g and Pay-for-Delete Negotiation

Please provide: (1) original contract/authority, (2) full itemization, (3) proof of assignment, (4) DOFD reported to CRAs, (5) collector license.
Cease phone contact. Upon validation, I’m prepared to resolve on a written Pay-for-Delete basis at {{ pct }}% (${{ amount }}).
