Subject: Direct Dispute under FCRA §623 – Reconcile / Delete Duplicative Tradeline

To the Chase Executive Office:

I am submitting a direct dispute regarding conflicting tradeline data associated with my Chase account
ending *4155 and a separate JPMCB tradeline ending *4978. Please identify the accurate live account of
record and reconcile the reporting so only one complete and accurate tradeline remains.

If the *4155 account is the operative record, please delete the *4978 tradeline and update all limits, high
balances, and Date of First Delinquency values accordingly. Kindly provide written confirmation of the steps
taken and the records reviewed in resolving this dispute.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your written confirmation within the
statutory timeframe.

Sincerely,

{{ party.defendant_name }}
