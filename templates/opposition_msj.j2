DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Defendant opposes Summary Judgment. A genuine dispute of material fact exists because
Plaintiff’s own designated materials conflict on the “last payment” (Memo asserts ${{ facts.chase_last_payment_memo.amount }}
on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_memo.date }}; Affidavit swears ${{ facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.amount }} on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.date }}),
defeating account-stated as a matter of law. Plaintiff also failed to itemize the balance and to produce the full run of
statements despite designating “Periodic Billing Statements (pp. 1–49).”

Requested relief: deny Summary Judgment; alternatively, defer under Rule 56 to compel complete statements and
itemization; set for trial.
