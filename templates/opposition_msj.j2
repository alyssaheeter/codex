DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Defendant {{ party.defendant_name }} respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment. Genuine disputes of material fact and procedural defects require denial of the motion.

1. Conflicting Evidence on the Alleged “Last Payment.” Plaintiff’s own designated materials conflict on the
   purported last payment, creating a dispute for trial. The Plaintiff’s Memo asserts a ${{ fmt_money(facts.chase_last_payment_memo.amount) }}
   payment on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_memo.date }}, while the supporting affidavit swears the last payment
   was ${{ fmt_money(facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.amount) }} on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.date }}. These contradictions
   defeat the account-stated theory as a matter of law and preclude summary judgment.

2. Absence of Itemization and Complete Statements. Plaintiff fails to itemize the balance or provide the full run
   of periodic statements despite designating “Periodic Billing Statements (pp. 1–49).” Without a complete
   accounting, the Court cannot assess the claimed balance or the legality of fees and interest.

Requested Relief. Defendant asks the Court to deny the Motion for Summary Judgment. In the alternative,
Defendant requests that the Court defer ruling under Trial Rule 56 to compel production of the complete
statements and a detailed itemization, and to set the matter for trial following supplementation.
