Brief Declaration of Financial Hardship

I, {{ party.defendant_name }}, submit this declaration to summarize the circumstances impacting my current
ability to pay outstanding consumer obligations in full. In February 2024, I experienced a job loss that
significantly reduced household income. Since that time, I have taken on primary caregiving responsibilities
for a parent undergoing cancer treatment, which has further limited my availability to work and required
additional out-of-pocket expenses.

In September 2025, I also faced unexpected housing remediation costs to address urgent health and safety
issues. These combined events depleted emergency reserves and left me with limited disposable income.

This declaration is provided in good faith to document my hardship, support reasonable settlement
discussions, and explain why I am unable to offer more than the structured settlement percentages included
with my correspondence. I certify that the statements above are true and correct to the best of my
knowledge.
