DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE OR DISREGARD AFFIDAVIT PORTIONS

Defendant {{ party.defendant_name }} moves the Court, pursuant to Trial Rule 56(E) and the Rules of Evidence, to
strike or disregard the deficient portions of Plaintiff’s affidavit and supporting designations.

1. Internal Contradiction. The affidavit conflicts with Plaintiff’s own memorandum regarding the alleged last
   payment, swearing to ${{ fmt_money(facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.amount) }} on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_affidavit.date }} while the
   memorandum asserts ${{ fmt_money(facts.chase_last_payment_memo.amount) }} on {{ facts.chase_last_payment_memo.date }}. The contradiction
   renders the affiant’s testimony unreliable.

2. Hearsay and Lack of Foundation. The affiant offers business-record conclusions without laying the
   requisite foundation or attaching the referenced records. Trial Rule 56(E) requires personal knowledge and
   admissible evidence, which are lacking here.

3. Missing Itemization and Statements. The affidavit references “Periodic Billing Statements (pp. 1–49)” yet
   fails to attach the full statements or itemize the balance from charge-off to present. Without complete
   records, the balance testimony is conclusory.

Relief Requested. Defendant requests that the Court strike the contradictory paragraphs, disregard any balance
assertions lacking itemization or foundation, and order production of the complete page 1–49 statement set
prior to any renewed dispositive motion.
