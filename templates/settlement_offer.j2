Subject: Settlement Proposal – {{ name }} (Balance ${{ balance }})

Dear Counsel:

I appreciate your attention to the pending {{ name }} matter. I am writing to propose an amicable
resolution that acknowledges the documented financial hardship I am experiencing while allowing both
parties to avoid continued litigation risk and expense.

For Wave {{ wave }}, I can tender {{ pct }}% of the outstanding balance, which equals ${{ amount }}, as a
single lump-sum payment. Acceptance of this offer is contingent upon the following standard terms:

1. Full dismissal with prejudice (where litigation is pending) and mutual release of claims.
2. Each party bears its own attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
3. No post–charge-off interest, late fees, or other add-ons will be pursued or reported.
4. The account will be reported to all credit bureaus as “settled in full” within 30 days of payment.
5. The remaining balance will not be sold, reassigned, or collected by any third party.

Please confirm acceptance in writing so we may finalize a settlement agreement and payment logistics.
For ease of review, I have attached my hardship declaration outlining the circumstances driving this proposal.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to resolving this matter cooperatively.

Sincerely,

{{ party.defendant_name }}
