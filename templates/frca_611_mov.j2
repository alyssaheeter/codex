Subject: FCRA §611 Dispute & Method of Verification Request – JPMCB *4978 vs. Chase 4155

Dear Disputes Department:

I am formally disputing the accuracy of the JPMCB *4978 tradeline reporting on my credit file. The entry
shows a credit limit of ${{ fmt_money(facts.jpmcb_4978_cl) }}, a high balance of ${{ fmt_money(facts.jpmcb_4978_high) }}, and a Date of
First Delinquency of {{ facts.jpmcb_4978_dofd }}. These details are inconsistent with the Chase 4155 account that
is the subject of current litigation (credit limit ${{ fmt_money(facts.chase_4155_cl) }}), indicating the tradeline may be a
duplicate or fragment of the same obligation.

Please conduct a reasonable reinvestigation, delete or consolidate any duplicative reporting, and provide
a detailed Method of Verification. The MOV should identify the furnisher, the individual or department
contacted, and the specific account records relied upon for verification.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this dispute and request a written response within the 30-day
statutory period. Please mail your findings to the address above.

Sincerely,

{{ party.defendant_name }}
